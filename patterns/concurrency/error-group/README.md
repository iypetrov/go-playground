this pattern provided by the `golang.org/x/sync/errgroup` package, is an excellent tool for managing a group of goroutines and collecting their errors

particularly useful when you need to run multiple operations concurrently and want to handle their errors in a coordinated way

`errgroup.Group` type provides a way to wait for a collection of goroutines to complete and returns the first non-nil error (if any) from them
this makes it easy to manage concurrent operations that can fail independently while still providing a clear and manageable error handling strategy

great at:
- concurrent api calls where you need to aggregate results or handle errors
- parallel file operations where you want to stop processing if any file operation fails
- coordinated shutdown of multiple services or goroutines

itâ€™s worth noting that the error group pattern cancels all operations if any of them return an error
this can be beneficial in many cases, as it allows you to implement a fail-fast behavior

if you need more fine-grained control over error handling or if you want to continue processing even if some operations fail, you might need to implement a custom solution
